[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sagecodes/irsit-classification2-knn/master) *note*: Dataset is not hosted in repo. You must link if you'd like to run yourself.


## About:

This project / case study is for phase 1 of my [100 days of machine learning code](https://sageelliott.com/100daysofmlcode/) challenge.

This is a homework solution to a section in [Machine Learning Classification Bootcamp in Python](https://www.udemy.com/machine-learning-classification). 

#### Problem Statement:

Predict Species of Iris given 4 feature measurments

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)


## Technology used:

#### Model(s): 
- [k-nearest neighbors (knn)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
